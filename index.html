    <h3>About</h3>
    <div>
        I love machine learning, and I was talking about it at Holberton School.
        It was after a mock interview that one of my Mentors and I where talking,
        I went to take a picture of their code to remember later, and was too lazy
        to type it up. We talked about how if I could use machine learning to change
        the picture of the code into actual code it would be very impressive, so 
        here I am trying to do just that. My project while not complete (I need a 
        data set to train my learning algorithm on punctuation among other things)
        aims to one day allow the user to capture their whiteboarding and turn it into
        real code with just a few clicks or taps.
