    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Option 1 Demo</li>
        <img src="Feature1.jpg" alt="feature 1 image" width="75%" height="25%">
        <div>A quick demo of all the features, including running the neural network if the neural network data does not exist. Note the poor quality of translation due to the short amount of time spent training.</div>
        <div>The phrase should read: "The Fault in Our Power Supplies I fell in love the way your battery dies slowly and then all at once"</div>
        <li>Option 2 Main Program</li>
        <img src="Feature2.jpg" alt="feature 2 image" width="75%" height="25%">
        <div>In this case we are running ocr on the alphabet, the majority of the errors come from the flawed preprocessing</div>
        <li>Additional Options</li>
        <img src="Feature3.jpg" alt="feature 3 image" width="75%" height="25%">
        <div>The options 3-5 and 0 do the following:</div>
            <ul>
                <li>3: deletes the training data for the demo program</li>
                <li>4: deletes the training data for the main program</li>
                <li>5: provides simple instructions</li>
                <li>0: exits the program</li>
            </ul>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <div>
        I love machine learning, and I was talking about it at Holberton School.
        It was after a mock interview that one of my Mentors and I where talking,
        I went to take a picture of their code to remember later, and was too lazy
        to type it up. We talked about how if I could use machine learning to change
        the picture of the code into actual code it would be very impressive, so 
        here I am trying to do just that. My project while not complete (I need a 
        data set to train my learning algorithm on punctuation among other things)
        aims to one day allow the user to capture their whiteboarding and turn it into
        real code with just a few clicks or taps.
